/**
 * Turning YouTube Music's display metadata into something a lyrics database
 * will recognise.
 *
 * YTM's strings are built for a UI, not for lookup: artist channels are
 * called "<Artist> - Topic", the subtitle line is a decorated breadcrumb
 * ("Video • The Weeknd • 1B views"), and titles carry upload furniture like
 * "(Official Music Video)". Every one of those was being sent to the lyrics
 * providers verbatim (sources.ts passed `track.title` straight through).
 *
 * Upstream measured each against the live LRCLIB search, baseline
 * "Blinding Lights" / "The Weeknd" = 20 hits:
 *
 *   "The Weeknd - Topic"                  ->  1
 *   "Song • The Weeknd"                   ->  1
 *   "Video • The Weeknd • 1B views"       ->  0
 *   "Blinding Lights (Official Music …)"  ->  0
 *   "アイドル【MV】"                       ->  0
 *   "Die For You (feat. Ariana Grande)"   ->  5   (vs 20)
 *
 * Re-measured on this library's own 73 played tracks: cleaning the title
 * recovers two tracks that returned zero LRCLIB candidates raw
 * ("STAY HERE 4 LIFE (Visualizer)", "Too Many Nights (ChoppedNotSlopped)
 * (feat. Don Toliver)") and loses none.
 *
 * Two things deliberately left alone, also from measurement:
 *   - Joining several artists with ", " costs nothing (20 either way), so
 *     there is no reason to reduce to a primary artist and risk dropping
 *     the one the database actually credits.
 *   - Version qualifiers like "(Remix)" cost nothing either (20 hits), so
 *     they stay in. Stripping them would erase the only thing separating a
 *     remix from its original, i.e. trade "not found" for "wrong lyrics".
 *
 * Kept dependency-free so it is unit-testable and usable from any path that
 * needs lookup metadata rather than display metadata.

 * downside is bounded, since it is only tried once the ordinary reading has
 * already come back empty.
 *
 * Known limit on THIS library: the rule assumes "Artist - Title", and the
 * one row here it fires on is the other way round ("RAKHLO TUM CHHUPAKE -
 * Arpit Bala", credited to the uploader "Kevin Yadav"), so it splits
 * backwards. Measured over all 73 played tracks that costs nothing — the
