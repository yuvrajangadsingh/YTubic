//! Pins the app's Windows AppUserModelID (AUMID) onto the process.
//!
//! Windows resolves the "source app" name + icon of a System Media Transport
//! Controls tile (the Quick Settings / volume-flyout media card) by taking the
//! media session's AUMID and matching it against a Start Menu shortcut that
//! carries the same AUMID. Tauri's NSIS installer stamps that AUMID — the
//! bundle identifier — onto the shortcuts it creates, so an installed build
//! resolves to "YTubic" + icon for free.
//!
//! But a media session only carries our AUMID if the *process* has one. A
//! launch that doesn't go through a shortcut (autostart's Run entry, a direct
//! exe run, `tauri dev`) otherwise reports a system-derived AUMID that matches
//! no shortcut, and the tile reads "Unknown app". Setting it explicitly here —
//! to the exact value the installer uses — makes every launch resolve.
//!
//! (The tile itself is created by souvlaki in media.rs; this just gives it an
//! identity Windows can name.) Windows-only; a no-op elsewhere.

/// Pin the app's AUMID onto the process. Call once at the very start of `run()`,
/// before any window is created, so each window (and thus souvlaki's SMTC
/// session) inherits it.
